Hey!
It's me I'm Muhammad Uzair.
I will never allow to copy my project.
So take an idea from this but never use it for your protofolio or other sources.
Thanks!

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

So my Github is: https://github.com/uzairdeveloper2

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
